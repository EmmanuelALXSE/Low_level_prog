This repository holds some projects I worked on for Holberton School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

Concepts to be learned in this repository:
what recursion is and how to use it
Description of what each file shows:
a function that prints a string, followed by a new line (puts)
a function that prints a string in reverse
a function that returns the length of a string
a function that returns the factorial of a given number
a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y (pow)
a function that returns the natural square root of a number
